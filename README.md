# Assignment
---
## Overview
Your assignment is to create a “product” that will be pitched to a VC (Venture Capital) firm. Your product must be a transactional web app that performs a useful task and utilizes an API, database, and server-side programming.

### Objectives
- Work collaboratively as a team to build an interactive web application
- Demonstrate learned skills from the semester

### Tasks
Your task is to create a web app and define a business proposition based on the web app. The topic is up to you! It needs to have an intuitive interface and be interactive/useful. 

### Ideas
Below is an amazing compendium of ideas (also approximately halfway down the page is a list of public API's). You do not need to use any of these, but the list may get your ideas flowing!

- Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript and optionally jQuery
- Must use a database (SQL or NoSQL)
- Must use a server-side technology - you may use PHP or Node.js (or both!)
