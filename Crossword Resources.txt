Possible order of operations -
Daily download and maintain the current puzzle at all these sites when it is posted (insert to out SQL database)

First - check if we have that exact clue in a current daily puzzle
Then, optionally query historical database to see if has been asked by the NYtimes ever in the past
Last Resort - have the LLM guess (probably low success rate at this point?) or say it doesn't know
