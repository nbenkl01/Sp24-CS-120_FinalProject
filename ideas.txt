1. Hint giving app
Working on a difficult crossword puzzle, and want to get an idea as to what the answer is, but not the full thing? Get a helpful hint that leads you in the right direction, without giving you the answer
--API to an LLM (perhaps some less powerful free version), feed in question and known letters/length of word, ask for hint without giving the answer away
--support for multiple puzzle types?
--Try asking for multiple/3 levels of clues, revealed one at a time?
--Tested this on chatgpt and it seems to be reasonably good at it
--Might want to brainstorm more complexities to add so its not just another textbox for chatgpt - use a database somehow, store old queries for faster access?

4. "Swap-a-Roo” (Kangaroo Icon)
- Transactional web app allowing users to exchange pre-loved goods (books, games, clothes, tools, etc.).- start just with books and move to more if we have time
