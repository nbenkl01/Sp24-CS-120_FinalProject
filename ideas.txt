1. Hint giving app
Working on a difficult crossword puzzle, and want to get an idea as to what the answer is, but not the full thing? Get a helpful hint that leads you in the right direction, without giving you the answer
--API to an LLM (perhaps some less powerful free version), feed in question and known letters/length of word, ask for hint without giving the answer away
--support for multiple puzzle types?
--Try asking for multiple/3 levels of clues, revealed one at a time?
--Tested this on chatgpt and it seems to be reasonably good at it
--Might want to brainstorm more complexities to add so its not just another textbox for chatgpt - use a database somehow, store old queries for faster access?

Only 5 dollars to get what I think we would need to make if using rapidapi version

-Set gym plans, and record weight/sets/reps for each time you go to the gym, same for running time/distance

3.Flashcard App
-Create flashcards for studying, then quiz yourself on them
-Create questions like fill in the blank or multiple choice based on the provided word definition
-Not sure on API for this one - an LLM could help add supplementary definitions or help us choose what word to leave out in a fill in the blank game
